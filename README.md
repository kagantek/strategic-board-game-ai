     ```
     or
     ```bash
     python3 --version
     ```
   - If not installed, download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or use your package manager.

2. **Command Line Access**: Ensure you can access a terminal or command prompt.

3. **Optional**: It is recommended to use a virtual environment for managing dependencies.
